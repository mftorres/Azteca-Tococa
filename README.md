# Azteca-Tococa

This repository compiles code for the analyzis and visualization of ant and plant data that I generated during my PhD. The general aim of the project was to understand the population history of a mutualism distributed throughout a region with very recent geological changes.

The data comprises sanger and whole-genome sequences from Azteca ants and Tococa guianensis plants. All the material was collected in the lowland forests of Colombia under the relevant permits for material collections. All vouchers are stored in Colombian collections. 

This repository will be uptaded as frequently as possible and as the publications come out.
